# 🧠 Retail Sales Forecasting | End-to-End Data Science & Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting retail sales using historical transaction data.  
The goal is to deliver **actionable business insights** and **high-accuracy predictive modeling** by combining **Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization** into one comprehensive workflow.

The complete pipeline includes:
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful trends
- HPT & Machine Learning model development and deployment
- Interactive Power BI dashboard for business monitoring

---

## 🎯 Objectives & Goals
- Build an accurate **sales forecasting model** using Decision Tree Regressor.
- Perform **data-driven insights generation** to guide retail strategy.
- Deploy the model as a **Streamlit web application** for ease of use.
- Create an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for stakeholder decision-making.
- Showcase **end-to-end proficiency** in Data Analytics & Data Science.

## 🔍 Key Insights from the Analysis
From the EDA and dashboard exploration, the following business insights were derived:
- **Seasonal Demand Patterns**: Sales peak significantly during weekends and festive months.
- **Top Performing Categories**: Electronics and household goods contribute to 40%+ of revenue.
- **Promotional Impact**: Discounts and promotions lead to short-term spikes but reduce average profit margins if overused.
- **Store-Level Performance**: High-performing branches are clustered in urban areas with dense customer traffic.
- **Demand Variability**: Certain product families show high volatility, requiring better inventory planning.
